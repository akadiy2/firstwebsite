            <p class="main_text">I was a designated scrum master on various projects to promote the practice of scrum which helped the teams to deliver features iteratively in a fast changing environment. This was a fun experience as I enjoyed learning how to faciliate interactions between team members and teams itself. I am trying to understand system level thinking so taht I can become a better scrum master and a better developer in general. I am generally someone who likes to do everything. In addition to that I helped out the QA team in the aid of integration and manual testing to ensure that the product meets high performing standards. Some of the technologies I used to work with this are Cucumber, REST Assured, and JUnit. Obviously, Unit testing is the main activity I do as a good developer needs to focus on writing tests to break the code. I enjoy writing code and writing tests to automate it, I enjoy writing code because it makes me feel like I am doing something useful, and in addition to that I am helping solving little by little problems of the world. I enjoy solving problems and if a problem requires repetitive tasks, then I enjoy writing code to automate that. I enjoy writing restful apis, learning how to design webpages with HTML/CSS, and writing good clean code as an art that I can look at to feel proud of.</p>
